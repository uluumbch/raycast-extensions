# Average Saham Indonesia

A simple and fast [Raycast](https://raycast.com) extension for Indonesian stock investors to calculate their new average stock price (Average Up / Average Down) — instantly, right from Raycast.

## What is this?

Average Saham Indonesia solves one problem really well:

> "I want to know my new average price after buying additional shares."

No login. No internet connection. No portfolio tracking (yet). Just type in your existing position and your new purchase, and get your new average price instantly as you type.

Calculations follow the Bursa Efek Indonesia (IDX) standard: **1 Lot = 100 Shares**.

## Features

- ⚡️ Instant, real-time calculation — no submit button, no loading state
- 🇮🇩 Indonesian-first UI (Harga Lama, Lot Lama, Harga Baru, Lot Baru)
- 🧮 Accurate average price (Average Up / Average Down) calculation
- 🔒 100% offline — no network requests, no accounts, no tracking
- ⌨️ Keyboard-first, minimal UI

## Installation

This extension isn't published to the Raycast Store yet. To run it locally:

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start it in development mode
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open Raycast and search for **Average Saham Indonesia**

## Usage

1. Open Raycast and search for `Average Saham Indonesia`
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Harga Lama** — your previous average buy price
   - **Lot Lama** — how many lots you already own
   - **Harga Baru** — the price of your new purchase
   - **Lot Baru** — how many lots you're buying now
3. Read your result instantly:
   - **Total Lot** — your total lot holding after this purchase
   - **Total Modal** — your total capital invested
   - **Average Price** — your new average price (Average Up / Average Down)

### Example

| Field      | Value  |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Harga Lama | 106.97 |
| Lot Lama   | 15     |
| Harga Baru | 80     |
| Lot Baru   | 10     |

Result:

```
Total Lot      25
Total Modal    Rp240.455
Average Price  Rp96,18
```

## Formula

```
Old Shares = Old Lot × 100
New Shares = New Lot × 100

Old Investment = Old Price × Old Shares
New Investment = New Price × New Shares

Total Investment = Old Investment + New Investment
Total Shares     = Old Shares + New Shares

Average Price = Total Investment / Total Shares
```
